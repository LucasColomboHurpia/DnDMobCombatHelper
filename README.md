# DnDMobCombatHelper
Project using jQuery and Bootstrap. A combat helper tool for dungeons and dragons. Desgined for encounters with a huge amount of enemies. We all know sometimes Mob-Rules can be a bit clunky to use, why not just roll every attack against your player's CA? And it even calculates advantages!

Planning of updating this with more features soon.
